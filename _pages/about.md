I am a PhD student in accessible and low-resource NLP, focusing on machine translation and text simplification, at the University of Amsterdam. I work with Christof Monz and Khalil Sima'an. I have a MSc in Speech & Language Processing from Edinburgh University, and a BA in Linguistics from Cambridge University. Before starting my PhD I worked in NLP research at Inria, Paris; City University London; and the UK Government. My academic interests include:

- Machine translation
- Low-resource and sample efficient NLP
- Text simplification
- Theoretical syntax

For my [Master's dissertation](https://github.com/Sethjsa/Sethjsa.github.io/blob/master/MSc%20SLP%20Dissertation%20-%20B178385_7979.pdf), I was supervised by [Miloš Stanojević](https://stanojevic.github.io) and [Mark Steedman](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/).

My publications are available [here](./publications.md) and on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=R9VK010AAAAJ).

<!-- I also occasionally write blog posts about my research. -->
